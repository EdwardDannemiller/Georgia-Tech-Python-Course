#In this problem, your goal is to write a function that can
#either count all the vowels in a string or all the consonants
#in a string.
#
#Call this function count_letters. It should have two
#parameters: the string in which to search, and a boolean
#called find_consonants. If find_consonants is True, then the
#function should count consonants. If it's False, then it
#should instead count vowels.
#
#Return the number of vowels or consonants in the string
#depending on the value of find_consonants. Do not count
#any characters that are neither vowels nor consonants (e.g.
#punctuation, spaces, numbers).
#
#You may assume the string will be all lower-case letters
#(no capital letters).


#Add your code here!
def count_letters(aString, find_consonants):
    count = 0
    vowels = "aeiou"
    
    if not find_consonants:
        for letter in aString:
            if letter in vowels:
                count += 1
        return count
    else:
        for letter in aString:
            if (ord(letter) >= 97) and (ord(letter) <= 122):
                if not letter in vowels:
                    count += 1
        return count



#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print 14, then 7.
