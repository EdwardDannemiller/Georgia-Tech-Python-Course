#Below we have given you the code for three classes: Owner,
#Pet, and Name.
#
#An Owner is defined by two attributes: a Name and a list of
#Pets. The list of pets is initially empty; it can be added
#to later.
#
#A Pet is defined by two attributes: a Name and an Owner.
#
#A Name is defined by two attributes, both strings,
#representing first and last name.
#
#Write a function called get_owner_string that will take as
#input a single instance of Pet. The function should then print
#out the Pet's Owner's name using the following format:
#
#Boggle Joyner's owner is David Joyner.
#
#You will need to access the Pet's first name, pet's last name,
#pet's owner's first name, and pet's owner's last name to
#accomplish this. You may NOT modify the Name, Pet, or Owner
#classes (we will test your code with our own copies of these
#classes, so any changes you make will not be part of our
#grading code).
#
#HINT: To access a pet's name, you would use the_pet.name. So,
#to access only the pet's first name, you would use
#the_pet.name.first. To access a pet's owner's, you would use
#the_pet.owner. So, how would you access the pet's owner's
#first and last name?

class Name:
    def __init__(self, first, last):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last

class Pet:
    def __init__(self, name, owner):
        self.name = name
        self.owner = owner
        
class Owner:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.pets = []

#Add your get_owner_string function here!
def get_owner_string(aPet):
    result = "{0} {1}'s owner is {2} {1}.".format(aPet.name.first, aPet.owner.name.last, aPet.owner.name.first)
    return result


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print:
#Boggle Joyner's owner is David Joyner.
#Artemis Joyner's owner is David Joyner.
#Pippin Hepburn's owner is Audrey Hepburn.
