#This problem uses the same Pet, Owner, and Name classes from
#the previous problem.
#
#In this one, instead of printing a string that lists a single
#pet's owner, you will print a string that lists all of a
#single owner's pets.
#
#Write a function called get_pets_string. get_pets_string should
#have one parameter, an instance of Owner. get_pets_string
#should return a list of that owner's pets according to the
#following format:
#
#David Joyner's pets are: Boggle Joyner, Artemis Joyner
