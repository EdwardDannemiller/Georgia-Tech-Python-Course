#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Above we have created five variables: name, verb, and where
#which are strings, number which is an integer, and result,
#which is a boolean.
#
#Below, write some code that will take these variables and
#print out the sentence below with the values of the variables
#filling in the corresponding spots in the sentence as
#indicated by the variable name in brackets.

#My name is [name] and it is [result] that I [verb] across [where] [number] times.
#
#Make sure to watch out for the data types of the values of
#each of these variables, and make sure you have the right
#number of spaces between each part!
#
#
#Add your code below:

print("My name is", name, "and it is", result, "that I", verb, "across", where, number, "times.")
