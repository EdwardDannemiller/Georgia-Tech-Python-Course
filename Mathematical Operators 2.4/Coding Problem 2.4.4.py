#Imagine you are a professor and trying to determine whether
#you should curve the grades for an exam based on the class 
#average. You are given the exam scores for your class of 10
#students above. Find the class average; if it is less than 70,
#then the exam should be curved.
#
#Once you have determined whether the exam should be curved,
#print the following string: "The exam should be curved: True."
#If the exam should not be curve, use 'False' instead of 'True',
#but either way, make sure to include the period after the
#result.

#Add your code here! With the initial values of the 10 variables
#above, your result should be True.
