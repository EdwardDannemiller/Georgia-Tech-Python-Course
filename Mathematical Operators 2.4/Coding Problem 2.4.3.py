#The Arrhenius equation is a formula used in physical
#chemsitry to show temperature dependence on reaction rates.
#A modified form of the equation is showed below:
#
# k = A x T^n x e^(-Ea/(R x T))
#
#Where k is a rate constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin,
#n is some constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is
#the activation energy, R is the universal gas constant, and
#e is the mathematical constant.

#
#Below, write some lines of code that replicates this modified
#Arrhenius equation using the variables created above as the
#different factors in the equation, and print out the resulting
#value of k. For the mathematical constant e, we have imported
#e from the math library so you can simply use e to access this
#value (as if it's a variable defined above as well).
#
#You should round the result to two decimal places. To do this,
#you can use Python's built-in round() function. To use it, use
#the following syntax:
#
#rounded_num = round(original_num, 2)
#
#The syntax on the line above will round original_num to 2
#decimal points and assign the result to rounded_num.

#With the current values of these variables, your code should
#output 768.95.

from math import e

#Write your code here!

# k = A x T^n x e^(-Ea/(R x T))
k = A * (T ** n) * (e ** (((-1 * Ea) / (R * T))))

rounded_k = round(k, 2)

print(rounded_k)
