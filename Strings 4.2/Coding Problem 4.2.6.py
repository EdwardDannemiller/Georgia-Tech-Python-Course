#Write a function called 'string_type' which accepts one
#string argument and determines what type of string it is. 
#
# - If the string is empty, return "empty".
# - If the string is a single character, return "character".
# - If the string represents a single word, return "word".
#   The string is a single word if it has no spaces.
# - If the string is a whole sentence, return "sentence".
#   The string is a sentence if it contains spaces, but
#   at most one period.
# - If the string is a paragraph, return "paragraph". The
#   string is a paragraph if it contains both spaces and
#   multiple periods (we won't worry about other
#   punctuation marks).
# - If the string is multiple paragraphs, return "page".
#   The string is a paragraph if it contains any newline
#   characters ("\n").
#
#Hint: think carefully about what order you should check
#these conditions in.
#
#Hint 2: remember, there exists a count() method that
#counts the number of times a string appears in another
#string. For example, "blah blah blah".count("blah")
#would return 3.


#Write your function here!

    if aString == "":

    if len(aString) == 1:
        return "character"

        return "word"
    if len(aString.split(".")) <= 2:
        return "sentence"
    if "\n" in aString:
        return "page"
    return "paragraph"
