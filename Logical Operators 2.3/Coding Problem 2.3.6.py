#next summer, but you plan on only applying to companies that
#you are interested in and companies whose requirements you meet.

#You'll only apply to the company if your GPA either matches or
#is greater than the company's required GPA. Even then you'll
#only apply to them if the major they are recruiting is your
#major. However if you are not the major they are recruiting,
#you'll still apply to them if your interest matches the interest
