#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!

#Imagine you commute to your classes and want to write code to 
#determine when it is appropriate for you to go to class based
#on the following conditions:
#
# - If you have an exam, then you should go to class, regardless
#   of the weather.
# - If you do not have an exam and it is sunny outside, then you
#   want to go to class if either of the following are true: you
#   have sunblock  and your classes are in the morning or your
#   classes are at night.
# - If you do not have an exam and it is raining outside, then
#   you want to go to class if you have a rain jacket.
# - If you do not have an exam and it is snowing, then you want
#   to go if any of the following are true: your friends are
#   going and you have a fluffy coat, you have snow boots and a
#   fluffy coat, or you just really want to go to class.

#If none of the previously stated conditions are true, then you
#do not want to go to class.

#Once you have determined if you should go to class, print the 
#following statement without the quotation marks, where "___"
#corresponds to the boolean that you have found:
#"True or false: I should go to class: ___"

#Add your code here! #With the initial inputs, your code
#should print:
#True or false: I should go to class: False
