#There are six logical operations to compare two boolean
#values. They are:
#
#  And: True if both are True, False otherwise
#   Or: True if either is True, False otherwise.
#  Xor: True if exactly one is True; False if both are True
#       or both are False ("Exclusive Or")
# Nand: False if both are True, True otherwise.
#  Nor: False if either is True, True otherwise.
# Xnor: False if exactly one is True; True if both are True
#       or both are False.
#
#For a and b above, print the results of all six operations,
#with the following format:
#
#And: False
#Or: True
#Xor: True
#Nand: True
#Nor: False
#Xnor: False
#
#Add your code below! Be aware: there is no dedicated operator
#in Xor, Nand, Nor, or Xnor. You'll have to find those values
#through a combination of And, Or, and Not.
