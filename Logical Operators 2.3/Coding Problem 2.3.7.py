#You've been studying for your test for a few hours and you're
#trying to decide if you can go to bed or if you need to study
#longer.
#
#To go to bed, you need to feel prepared. Even if you "feel"
#prepared, you need to make sure you have prepared adequately:
#that means reviewing for at least 2 hours (review_time), or
#at least 4 hours if the test is worth 20 percent or more of
#your grade.
#
#So, to go to bed, you must feel prepared (feel_prepared must
#be True), and you must have reviewed for 2 or more hours
#(review_time must be greater than or requal to 2). If the
#test is worth 20% or more (test_percent is greater than
#or equal to 20), you should have reviewed for 4 or more hours
#(review_time greater than or equal to 4).
#
#Add your code below! It should print True if you can go to
#bed, False if you cannot.
