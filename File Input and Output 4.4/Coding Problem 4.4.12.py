#Write a function called write_1301 which will write a file
#in the format described in Coding Problem 4.4.2. The
#sample.cs1301 file has been included to refresh your 
#memory. Your function should accept two arguments:
#A string of a filename to write to, and a list of tuples. 
#You can assume that each tuple will have the following 
#format:
#
#(int, str, int, int, float)
#
#Each tuple will represent a line in the file, and each
#item in the tuple should correspond to the 
#assignment number, the assignment name, the student's 
#grade, the total possible number of points, and the 
#assignment weight respectively. 


#Write your function here!
def write_1301(fileName, aList):
    myFile = open(fileName, 'w')
    for item in aList:
        myString = "{0} {1} {2} {3} {4}".format(item[0], item[1], item[2], item[3], item[4])
        print(myString, file = myFile)
    myFile.close()


#The code below will test your function. It's not used
#for grading, so feel free to modify it! You may check
#output.cs1301 to see how it worked.
